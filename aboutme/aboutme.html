        As of the writing of this paragraph, I am a criminal justice major and a computer science minor. I previously wanted to get into law enforcement until I took a computer science course. After I experienced a computer science class, which was an introduction course to C++ and I enjoyed it and decided that I would enjoy persuing a career in software engineering more than law enforcement. This website is being created to display my portfolio and to assist me in learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
